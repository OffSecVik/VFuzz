	NEXT STEPS

> fix subdomain mode!

> FIX Headers in ArgParse (currently completely skips ConfigManager and simply adds headers to a static HashSet as a workaround)

-> Decide on Threshold Values (Rate Limit - 4000? Seems arbitrary?)

> implement CPU and RAM metrics
> FUZZ mode where we can specify something like http://admin.mysite.com/FUZZ/login.php
-> FUZZ mode AND FILE mode both use the fuzzMarker

> Print Class for pretty output and progress bar

> File Extension Fuzzing

> TEST FILE MODE (I know it will be buggy)

> Flags:
	-a --user-agent (User-Agent) (CONFLICT CHECK with --random-agent)
	--random-agent (set random user agent)
	-C Cookie
