	NEXT STEPS

> Consider if we want compatibility between FileRequest mode and -H flag (and other flags) and if not, determine how to handle the user specifying both

> FIX Headers in ArgParse (currently completely skips ConfigManager and simply adds headers to a static HashSet as a workaround)

-> Decide on Threshold Values (Rate Limit - 4000? Seems arbitrary?)

> implement CPU and RAM metrics

> Print Class for pretty output and progress bar

> File Extension Fuzzing

> TEST FILE MODE (I know it will be buggy)

> Flags:
	-C Cookie
