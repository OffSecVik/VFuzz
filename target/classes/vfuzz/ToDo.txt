	NEXT STEPS

> have --exclude-length exclude ranges of lengths (e.g. 200-450)

> allow ranges in status codes

> DESIGN CHOICE: Rate Limiter on or off by default?
-> Decide on Threshold Values -> have user supply them?

> implement CPU and RAM metrics
-> maybe while doing that find out what is hogging the CPU
-> Use Java Profiler to index performance?
> FUZZ mode where I can specify something like http://admin.mysite.com/FUZZ/login.php
-> FUZZ mode AND FILE mode both use the fuzzMarker

> Print Class for pretty output and progress bar

> File Extension Fuzzing

> TEST FILE MODE (I know it will be buggy)

> Flags:
	-H (add Header) -> have to be able to add large number of headers! - //TODO TEST IT
	-d (send post data, automatically sets RequestMode to POST) (CONFLICT CHECK)
	-a --user-agent (User-Agent) (CONFLICT CHECK with --random-agent)
	--random-agent (set random user agent)
	-C Cookie
	-r (read request from file) // TODO TEST IT
