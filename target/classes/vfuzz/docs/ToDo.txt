	NEXT STEPS

> fix -r mode throwing errors with bad request file

> Currently with a single thread and recursive mode, new recursive targets receive 0 threads.
    Rethink if this conservative approach is favorable over giving each new target 1 new thread, independent of the specified thread count by the user.

> Consider if we want compatibility between FileRequest mode and -H flag (and other flags) and if not, determine how to handle the user specifying both

> FIX Headers in ArgParse (currently completely skips ConfigManager and simply adds headers to a static HashSet as a workaround)

-> Decide on Threshold Values (Rate Limit - 4000? Seems arbitrary?)

> implement CPU and RAM metrics

> Print Class for pretty output and progress bar

> File Extension Fuzzing
